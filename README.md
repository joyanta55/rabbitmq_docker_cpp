# rabbitmq_docker_cpp
A Bazel template to create Docker images for C++ applications using AMQP-CPP (https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/AMQP-CPP). The `src/cpp/example` directory includes a sample file, `app.cpp`, which is built and packaged into a Docker container for the local Docker registry. This setup is dependency-free â€” all required headers and AMQP-CPP implementations can be handled directly in the `app.cpp` file.
